## Create a poll
1. Add the poll bot into your group
  * Remember to uncheck `Anonymous Voting` to see names.
1. Create a new poll in the group
  * The poll bot will recreate the poll so that it can receive updates when someone votes.
1. You can now delete your own poll after the poll bot has sent the new poll.
1. Get all voters to update their name in the section below before they can vote.

## Update voter's name

Before the poll bot can keep track of poll votes, all users need to tell the bot their name.

1. Message the poll bot `/name <Your name>`
  * Example: `/name Tan Xiao Ming`
